Takahe is an extension to Heloise Stevance's hoki code, which interfaces
with BPASS. It is designed to pick up where hoki leaves off, and allow
the user to specify binary star systems from the BPASS library, and
propagate those in time to investigate binary star mergers.

Takahe is a part of my Masters of Science thesis at the University of
Auckland, and is in constant, rolling development.
