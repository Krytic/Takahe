[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/takahe/badge/?version=latest)](https://takahe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Takahe is a simple libary that takes binary star systems (such as the [BPASS model sets](https://bpass.auckland.ac.nz/)), and allows you to evolve them through time, to see how they merge, when they merge, and what happens in the final moments before merger.

## Installation

Installation is handled via pip. Currently the package is not released on pypi but can be installed with `pip install -e .` in the root directory.

## Documentation

You can read Takahe's latest documentation [here](https://takahe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or documentation for specific versions can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/Krytic/Takahe/releases/).

## Contributing

(2018).

### The name "Takahe"

The name Takahe conforms to the naming convention employed by Eldridge, Stanway, Stevance, et al. BPASS releases are named after native creatures from New Zealand (e.g. Tuatara, the current version, is named for the native reptile known as the "living fossil"), as is hoki (being named for a fish). The Takahe is a native endangered flightless bird to New Zealand, and is regarded as taonga (treasure) to NgƒÅi Tahu, an iwi (tribe) in the South Island.
